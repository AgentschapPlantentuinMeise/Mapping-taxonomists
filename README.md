You may also need to install SPARQLWrapper, geopandas and fiona to your Python installation.

i.e. using `pip install SPARQLWrapper`

The countries included in the analysis are listed by there two-letter ISO code (ISO 3166-1) in file `included_countries.txt`, in directory `.\src\data`.

This analysis can be replicated by copying the repository and running `make_dataset.py` from the `src` folder. This file runs, in order, the following files:
## 1.  `list_journals.py` which finds possible taxonomic journals through WikiData and OpenAlex

### Data Retrieval
We employed a two-fold approach to gather taxonomic journals:
Wikidata Query for Taxonomic Subjects: Using the SPARQL query language, we constructed queries to retrieve journals from Wikidata associated with taxonomy-related concepts. These concepts were identified by their respective Wikidata identifiers, including taxonomy (Q8269924), biological classification (Q11398), plant taxonomy (Q1138178), animal taxonomy (Q1469725), and several others. Due to the complexity of the query and data size, the query was split into two parts to accommodate additional concepts such as systematics (Q3516404) and phylogenetics (Q171184).
Wikidata Query for IPNI and ZooBank Identifiers: In addition to subject-based searches, we queried Wikidata for journals that possess an International Plant Names Index (IPNI) or ZooBank publication identifier. These identifiers are pivotal in the field of taxonomy for the formal naming of plants and animals. The query extracted relevant metadata, such as journal titles, ISSN numbers, and geographical information, as well as IPNI and ZooBank IDs.

OpenAlex Query for Taxonomy-Related Journals: We accessed the OpenAlex API to retrieve journals associated with the taxonomy concept (concepts.id). The results were filtered to include only sources categorized as journals, excluding non-journal entities like e-book platforms. The OpenAlex data added another valuable dimension to the dataset by linking additional open-access sources of taxonomic literature.

### Data Homogenization
To ensure consistency across data from different sources, we applied a series of preprocessing steps:

Wikidata Value Extraction: Metadata from the Wikidata results, such as journal URLs, ISSN-L, and publication IDs, were often nested in dictionaries. We extracted these values using a custom function to flatten the structure and standardize column names.

OpenAlex ID Standardization: The OpenAlex data was processed to update older ID formats (e.g., V123 to S123) and align these with the Wikidata format. This step ensured uniformity across sources when cross-referencing journal identifiers.

Handling Dissolved Journals: Journals marked as dissolved in the metadata were flagged and a boolean column was added to indicate whether a journal had ceased publication before 2013, a key year for our study's scope.

### Data Integration and Deduplication
Following the extraction and homogenization of data from both Wikidata and OpenAlex, the datasets were concatenated into a unified dataframe. We retained essential columns such as journal title, ISSN-L, IPNI and ZooBank publication IDs, OpenAlex IDs, and dissolution status.

To prevent redundancy, we performed deduplication based on unique combinations of Wikidata and OpenAlex identifiers. The resulting dataset provides a robust list of taxonomic journals, capturing diverse metadata and identifiers crucial for further bibliometric analyses.

The final dataset was saved in two formats: a complete list and a deduplicated list, ensuring a clean and comprehensive repository of taxonomic journals.

## 2.  `get_articles.py` which extracts the articles from these journals and filters out articles about taxonomy, as well as filtering out  

### Data Collection
The process of obtaining taxonomic articles was divided into several steps:
1. Journals Data Preparation: We began by loading a previously curated dataset of taxonomic journals from Wikidata and OpenAlex. This dataset, stored in journals.csv, contained key metadata about journals, including their OpenAlex IDs and dissolution status. Only journals that had valid OpenAlex IDs and were still active during the study period (i.e., not dissolved) were included in the query process.
2. Directory Cleanup: To ensure that the new data collected was clean and not mixed with previous results, we cleared the directory containing raw article files by removing all files stored in the articles directory.
3. Querying OpenAlex for Journal Articles: The next step involved querying the OpenAlex API to obtain articles from each taxonomic journal. This was done for journals with valid OpenAlex IDs and for articles published between 2013 and 2022. We excluded PLOS ONE from the general search as it has a large number of taxonomic articles (~240,000) and handled it separately.
4. Handling PLOS ONE: Due to its high volume of taxonomic articles, PLOS ONE articles were retrieved first and filtered using a custom keyword filter to identify taxonomic articles that met specific criteria. These filtered articles were stored in intermediate files for further processing.
5. Downloading Articles in Batches: For each journal in the dataset, we queried OpenAlex for articles using the journal's OpenAlex ID. We kept track of the total number of articles downloaded in each batch, splitting the dataset every time 10,000 articles were retrieved. For each batch of articles:
* The raw data was saved.
* A keyword filter was applied to extract taxonomic articles based on predefined keywords.
* The keyword-filtered articles were stored in intermediate files.
6. Final Download and Processing: After downloading all articles from the selected journals, the final batch of articles was processed similarly by applying the keyword filter and saving the results. All keyword-filtered articles were merged to create a single unified dataset of taxonomic articles.

### Data Processing and Filtering
Once all articles had been downloaded and filtered, the following processing steps were applied:
1. Merging and Flattening: The keyword-filtered articles were merged into a single dataframe using the merge_pkls function from the prep_articles module. The resulting articles were then "flattened" to create a clean structure, ensuring that nested metadata was properly extracted and that the articles were formatted uniformly for analysis.
2. European Taxonomic Articles: Although not fully implemented in the provided code, a filter for European articles (filter_eu_articles) could be applied to isolate articles relevant to European taxonomic research. This step would involve filtering based on geographical information or institutional affiliations.

## 3.  `parse_taxonomy.py` which parses the abstracts of these articles for species names

### Data Preparation
1. Loading Filtered Articles: The dataset containing filtered taxonomic articles was loaded from a pre-processed pickle file (filtered_articles.pkl). This dataset includes articles that had already been filtered based on their relevance to taxonomy through a keyword-based process.

2. Abstract Conversion: The abstracts in the dataset were stored in an inverted index format, which is a structured and compressed representation of the text. To facilitate the parsing process, these indexed abstracts needed to be converted back into plain text. The script iterated over each article and checked if the abstract was available in an inverted index format.
* If the abstract was present, the `inverted_index_to_text` function from the `prep_taxonomy` package was used to reconstruct the full abstract text.
* If no abstract was available, a `None` value was assigned to that entry.
The converted abstracts were then added to the dataframe in a new column, `abstract_full_text`, providing easy access to the full text for subsequent processing.

### Taxonomic Subject Parsing
3. GBIF Taxonomic Backbone: The GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) taxonomic backbone was used as the reference for identifying taxonomic subjects within the articles. This backbone includes a comprehensive list of species names and higher taxa, which are crucial for determining if an article mentions a recognized species.

The backbone was pre-processed using the `preprocess_backbone` function from the `prep_taxonomy` package, ensuring that the data was clean and structured for efficient parsing.

4. Parsing Articles for Taxonomy: The core of the workflow involved parsing both the abstract and title of each article for mentions of species recorded in the GBIF taxonomic backbone. This was achieved through the `parse_for_taxonomy` function, which:

Searched each article's title and abstract for references to species or other taxonomic entities.
Cross-referenced these mentions with the GBIF backbone to confirm if the mentioned species or taxa were officially recognized.
The function added metadata to the articles, indicating which species or taxonomic subjects were identified in each article.

## 4.  `get_authors.py` which extracts the authors from these articles
### Global Author Extraction
1. **Loading Taxonomic Articles**:  
   The script begins by loading a pre-processed dataset of taxonomic articles, which includes articles where taxonomic subjects, such as species, have been identified. This dataset is stored in the `taxonomic_articles_with_subjects.pkl` file and contains the necessary metadata, including author information.

2. **Extracting Authors**:
   The next step is to extract the **author information** from each article using the `get_authors` function from the custom `prep_authors` package. This function scans through the articles and compiles a list of all contributing authors.

3. **Isolating Single Authors**:  
   Once the complete list of authors is generated, we use the `get_single_authors` function to filter out instances where an author is listed multiple times across different articles. This function ensures that each author appears only once in the output, allowing us to obtain a unique list of taxonomic authors.

4. **Storing Global Author Data**:  
   The global author data is saved in two intermediate files:
   - **`all_authors_of_taxonomic_articles.pkl`**: This file contains the complete list of authors across all taxonomic articles.
   - **`single_authors_of_taxonomic_articles.pkl`**: This file contains the deduplicated list of authors, ensuring each author appears only once.

   These files are stored in the **`interim`** directory for further analysis or processing.

### European Author Extraction

5. **Processing European Articles**:  
   Although the section processing European taxonomic articles is commented out, the intended steps are as follows:
   - A separate dataset of **European taxonomic articles** (stored in `european_taxonomic_articles_with_subjects.pkl`) would be loaded.
   - Similar to the global workflow, the authors of these articles would be extracted using the `get_authors` function, and single authors would be isolated using `get_single_authors`.

6. **Filtering by Country**:  
   The key feature of this section is the extraction of authors based on their country of affiliation. The **`get_country_authors`** function filters the global author dataset to retain only those authors associated with specific countries (likely European countries). This allows for a geographically-targeted analysis of taxonomic research.

7. **Deduplicating European Authors**:  
   The **`get_single_authors`** function is applied again, this time on the European dataset, to ensure that authors are uniquely represented. This deduplicated list of European authors is particularly valuable for generating insights into regional taxonomic research.

8. **Storing European Author Data**:  
   The results for the European authors are saved in the following files:
   - **`country_authors_with_all_taxonomic_articles.pkl`**: This file contains all the authors from selected countries.
   - **`country_taxonomic_authors_no_duplicates.pkl`**: This file contains the deduplicated list of country-specific authors.
   - **`country_taxonomic_authors_no_duplicates.tsv`**: The deduplicated list is also saved as a TSV file for easy sharing and inspection.

## 5.  `disambiguate.py` which disambiguates said authors

This script aims to disambiguate authors from taxonomic articles and link them to the GBIF taxonomic backbone. The workflow involves preprocessing author names, linking them to species they study, and resolving duplicates by matching authors based on their affiliations and taxonomic subjects. The process also involves clustering similar authors to eliminate redundant entries while retaining accurate information about their research.

### Authors

1. **Loading and Simplifying the Dataset**:  
   The dataset containing taxonomic authors is loaded from the `country_taxonomic_authors_no_duplicates.pkl` file. Unnecessary columns are dropped, and the remaining columns include key fields like `author_id`, `author_display_name`, `author_orcid`, `inst_id` (institution ID), and `species_subject`.

2. **Generating Truncated and Stripped Names**:  
   For each author, the script generates two new forms of their name:
   - **Truncated Name**: This consists of the first initial and the last name.
   - **Stripped Name**: This is the author’s full name with spaces, periods, and hyphens removed, ensuring consistency across variations of the same name.
   
   These names help in matching authors with minor variations in name formatting.

### GBIF Taxonomic Backbone

3. **Loading the Taxonomic Backbone**:  
   The GBIF taxonomic backbone, containing species names and taxonomic ranks, is loaded from the `Taxon.tsv` file. Unnecessary columns are dropped, and only species with non-ambiguous taxonomic statuses are retained.

4. **Building a Dictionary for Faster Lookup**:  
   A dictionary (`seen_species`) is created where species names are keys, and their taxonomic order or family is the value. This allows for efficient matching between species names and taxonomic orders in later steps.

5. **Linking Authors to Taxonomic Orders**:  
   Each author is linked to the taxonomic orders of the species they study. The script iterates over every author and, for each species they study, adds the corresponding taxonomic order (or family if no order is available) from the GBIF backbone. Duplicate taxonomic orders are avoided.

6. **Matching Authors**:  
   The `match` function compares two authors to determine if they are likely the same person. The matching criteria are:
   - If both authors have no taxonomic orders associated with them, they are considered the same only if their institution and full name match.
   - If both have known taxonomic orders, they are considered the same if they share both an institution and at least one taxonomic order.

7. **Clustering Similar Authors**:  
   The `cluster` function groups similar authors into clusters based on their names, institutions, and taxonomic orders. These clusters represent potential duplicates of the same author.

8. **Resolving Duplicates**:  
   The script identifies duplicate authors by checking for matching truncated names. For each set of duplicates, it uses the `match` function to determine which authors are the same and clusters them together.

9. **Merging Author Information**:  
   For each cluster of duplicate authors, the script merges the information into a single record. The `collect_values` function ensures that information from all duplicates is combined without redundancy, especially for taxonomic orders and species subjects.

10. **Saving the Results**:  
    - The **merged people** (authors identified as duplicates and merged) are stored in `merged_people_truncated.csv`.
    - The final, disambiguated list of authors is saved as:
      - `authors_disambiguated_truncated.pkl`
      - `authors_disambiguated_truncated.tsv`

# Visualization
  
## maps.py Country Frequency

This Python script analyzes and visualizes the geographic distribution of authors' institutions by plotting country frequencies on maps. It processes the input data, calculates the frequency of authors by country, and generates maps displaying these distributions using **Geopandas** and **Matplotlib**.

### Key Features

1. **Frequency Calculation**: 
   The script includes a function `freq_countries` that processes a dataset of authors' institution country codes and calculates how frequently each country appears. It returns this information in a dictionary that links country codes to their respective author counts.

2. **Map Generation**:
   The core functionality of the script is to visualize these frequencies on maps. Using **GeoPandas**, the script loads a world map and maps each country’s author frequency onto it. Additionally, it supports generating maps that focus on Europe, as well as creating visualizations based on the relative frequency of authors (e.g., percentage of the population).

3. **Custom Color Mapping**:
   The script includes a custom color gradient, ranging from light green to dark blue, that is used in the maps to represent the frequency data, making it easier to differentiate regions with higher author counts.

### Input Data

The script requires two main input datasets, which are expected to be in pickle format:
1. **`single_authors_of_taxonomic_articles.pkl`**: This dataset contains information about authors of taxonomic articles, including the countries of their institutions.
2. **`country_taxonomic_authors_no_duplicates.pkl`**: This dataset is similar but contains a filtered version without duplicates, focusing on European authors.

Additionally, a **country codes** file (`country_codes.tsv`) is used to convert between different country code formats for proper map plotting.

### Output

The script produces several types of maps:
- A **global map** that shows the number of authors per country.
- A **European map** that zooms in on Europe and highlights country frequencies.
- A **relative map** for Europe that shows author frequencies as a percentage of the country’s population.
- Specialized maps for authors from the **EUJOT journal**, again including both absolute and relative frequencies.

All of these maps are saved as PNG files and stored in the `../../reports/figures/` directory.

### Conclusion

Once the script is run, you’ll find a series of maps that visually represent where authors of taxonomic articles are based, both globally and within Europe. The resulting visualizations offer an insightful view into the geographic distribution of the academic community in this field.
